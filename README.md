# Stars of Tomorrow - School Enrollment Form
A study project using HTML and CSS of an elementary school enrollment form. It was made as part of the Rocketseat MBA course and its objective is to practice the concepts of forms in depth and explore many of its applications in everyday code.

Please keep in mind that since it is a visual only study project, there is no javascript to add more validations, handlers and treatments to the form. So clicking the submit buttons will give you an error page, for example.
